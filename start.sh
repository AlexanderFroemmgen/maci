Please open the MACI web interface in your browser: http://localhost:63658
Depending on your internet connection, this may take some time.
For the impatient: 
  * You can check the current progress by invoking 'screen -r -d backend' for the MACI backend and 'screen -r -d jupyter' for the Jupyter service.
  * You can escape a screen by pressing 'Ctrl-A' and then 'D'. (NOT! Ctrl-C, which terminates the process.)
  * You can prepare to start over by invoking './stop.sh'."
